Gathered at our offices in Madrid, the team met again from different parts of Spain. It was a day of sharing, of exchanging innovative ideas, creative solutions, and of designing the roadmap for the exciting year ahead of us. The meeting was not only about work; it was also about strengthening ties and enjoying the festive season.<br><br>Christmas dinner was a special moment in an emblematic restaurant in the heart of Madrid, where we shared not only delicious dishes, but also laughter and memorable moments.<strong>Group activities, such as a Christmas lottery, added even more fun to the evening, creating even stronger bonds between us.</strong> At H&D Spain, the holiday season is not only a time for celebration, it is also a time to grow and to share!<br><br>If you are passionate, dynamic and would like to <strong>be part of our team</strong>, come and join us!<br><br><strong>Send us your CV and be part of a community committed to excellence</strong>, collaboration and enthusiasm for what we do.

What a joy to have them on board!<br>🎤 The project presentations were undoubtedly the highlight.<br>Ian Hacha caught us with a super dynamic talk about Rust, full of valuable insights about his current project. Afterwards, Miriam and Stephan Brandt blew us away with their vision and the inspiring work they are doing in the field of IKFZ (application for the management of vehicle registrations in Germany). 👏<br>😂 The funniest moment? The personal introductions. We each had to reveal our favorite series or movie, and we discovered that our tastes run the gamut from breathtaking thrillers to comedies that make your day. Now we have an infinite list for the next marathon.<br>💡 These team days remind us of something important: we are more than a tech company. We are a team eager to innovate, connect and enjoy the journey together."
